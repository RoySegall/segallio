It was _June 2011_ and Rotchild st. will start to fill with tents. I just quit my job in _Pizza Hut_ as a manager. Don't 
get me wrong - I love Pizza but for my professional life it seems that I can do more. I knew it. I'm learning how to 
program by my self from books since I was 15 years old and now, 21 years old I can go for it. But... Who would take me 
without any formal education? Not to talk about boot camps which at the time seems like something from the future. I 
need to start polishing my CV and send it. It doesn't matter - just send it. Eventually, it will hit and destiny will 
shine upon me!

I went to two job interviews. The first one was a small company - two people, which look unorthodox for a hi-tech 
company managers (but in a good way), two rooms, and a single developer with a single HR manager. Seems cozy. The second 
one was at a company that looks odd, not fully organized, uses a couple of technologies, and located at _Petah Tivka_. 
Seems a bit frightening for someone without any experience. As I walked home, I got a call from the first company - 
_gizra_ and they told me I got the job. I was thrilled!

At first, it was horrible. I got to work with something called _Drupal_, at the time seems complex but in a look back 
it's one of the best things I've got to work with. In _gizra_ all the myths about hi-tech companies are shuttered: you 
don't need to kill your self with long hours, the balance between personal life and professional life is at the top of 
priorities.

In _gizra_ I got to do amazing stuff - I worked on big and complex sites, I contributed back to open source projects, I 
got to write blog posts, I went to conferences and even organized a couple by my self (with help from other people as 
well). And it's not because they were 
tasks that we have to do, it's because my managers believed that we need to contribute back to the community. _gizra_ 
believed, and still believes, in automated QA, and taking care of the smallest details - even in the code comments 
which a lot of companies think it's redundant. I remember that CI and automation were a huge part of the time 
estimation. Those things are not something you can see in a lot of companies - especially project-based companies.

The time in _gizra_ will forever have a special place in my heart. Don't get me wrong, I quit due to professional 
reason - I looked for more. Pretty funny that this is the same reason I came to _gizra_ in the first place.
