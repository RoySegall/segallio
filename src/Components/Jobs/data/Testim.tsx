            In my career, I've had some awesome gigs, like at <em>Dreamed Diabetes</em> and <em>gizra</em>. But I missed
            the buzz of sharing ideas, blogging, and hanging out at meetupsâ€”it's what really gets me going. So, I started
            looking for a new job that fit the bill.

            Imagine this: I was on the lookout, but finding a company that ticked all my boxes â€” a cool product focus and
            an active blogâ€”seemed like finding a unicorn in Israel. Then, out of the blue, a recruiter mentioned
            <em>testim</em>. The more I learned, the more it felt like fate. Their thing? Making E2E tests a breeze
            without drowning in codeâ€”just what I needed after grappling with QA headaches at <em>Dreamed Diabetes</em>.

            Joining <em>testim</em> was a rollercoaster of learning! I dove into <em>Typescript</em>, <em>mobx</em>,
            <em>MongoDB</em>, and <em>Express</em>. The tech magic at <em>testim</em> blew my mind, teaching me loads
            about automation and why <em>mobx</em> rocks in managing stuff (though I'm up for a friendly debate on that ðŸ˜„).

            After a year, <em>testim</em> was acquired by <em>Tricentis</em>, a leading company in the QA domain with
            fantastic products. Yes, the transition to Tricentis was a bit of an emotional rollercoaster, but it opened
            doors to an incredible opportunityâ€”starting to work on a new product called <em>Testim Mobile</em>.

            My time at <em>Dreamed Diabetes</em> showed me how tough it is to automate mobile apps. Now, being part of
            the crew building <em>Testim Mobile</em> feels like a dream project where I can tackle those tough spots.
            Working on <em>testim</em> mobile has been epicâ€”we're crafting something that speaks to the challenges I've
            faced. The future? A bit of a mystery, but trust me, it's looking awesome.
