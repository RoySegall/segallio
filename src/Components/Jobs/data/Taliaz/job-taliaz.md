It true, I haven't been to a lot of companies over the years. I 'spent' 7 years at _gizra_ while other people can work 
for at least 3 companies. But on the other hand, working for a company for 7 straight years indicates loyalty, it's a 
bonus. But in my case, a lot of companies decided that my experience is not what they looking and skips to the next 
contestant.

_Taliaz_ is a different story. After being sick and tired for looking for a job a friend told me that he knows someone 
that looks for a full-stack developer. I gave it a shot. The process was very quick and I felt that that company is 
different from the other companies I interviewed. It was a small startup that started the expansion: hiring two people 
and aims for being bigger.

It was exactly something I was looking for. Being at a position where you can make a real impact. No longer a project 
with a company that after 1-2 years you don't have any relationship and the hard work you gave is not visible to your 
eyes. If I can describe it, it's like saying goodbye from one of your children.

At _Taliaz_ I was given the honor of starting to re-write the product. Choosing the backend (Symfony in my case) while 
the frontend will be chosen sometime in the future. In the beginning, I was looking for approval to do stuff. My CTO 
told me that I don't need it. Just build it. If it will not fit, we'll remove it. Then, something happens - a switch 
was turned on. From being used to wait for approval I needed to act fast and if something was bad, that's OK, we'll fix 
it and learn for the next time.

But, it turns that nothing good was last forever and in my case, shorter than I ever expected. After two months, just 
when I started to warm up I got the bad news - I'm fired. It's because they were out of money - the expected funding has 
not arrived.

P.S - I forgot to tell you what's _Taliaz_ purpose: they came up with an incredible solution - helping people with 
depression to find the best matching medicine with fewer side effects. That job fits me well because I love 'doing good' 
for other people.
