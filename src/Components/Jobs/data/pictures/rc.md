At my last 3 months over _gizra_, I got a bonus from my CTO, _Amitai_: Another project company needed help with a 
_Drupal_ project and I was sent to the task. It was something that I did with a customer in the past, _Harvard_, I 
needed to do two stuff: consulting with issues which related to _Drupal_, managed other employee and help them to 
maintain the project.

It was a very special period for me: I was looking for a job and went to job interviews but yet, I was doing consulting 
for another company which I know nothing about their organization workflow. It felt to me that I need to join another 
company, become one of their own for a very short period but still keep my eyes open for my next long term professional 
relationship.

From a social perspective, they were good! I felt I was at home and love the people. From my professional perspective, I 
couldn't take it anymore - another _Drupal_ project that has no CI nor automated tests. But, the team, project manager, 
and the CTO was very helpful and even propose a position. I declined because I was looking for something else.

Each company I've has been to, even for a short period, I take the good stuff and try to look at how it impacted me. 
From _Real Commerce_ I took the ability to look beyond to simple developer point of view and can see how the feature or 
the lack of infrastructure can hurt the development, got a better understand how _Drupal_ can help big organizations in 
these days, especially when there are cool technologies like _NodeJS_.
