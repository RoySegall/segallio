2018 was a rough year. I quit my job, and then I found another job which I loved very much. Then, I got fired. 
Surprisingly, I was looking for a job, again. Took me a couple of months but I found it. It was a, pardon my french, 
crappy job. It was so bad I rather not talk about it, and delete any reference of me being employed there. After three 
months I decided to quit and look for another job.

This time, I knew what I was looking for and the search was grueling, each place was not interested in my skills or it 
was something I did not want to do. But then, like a ray of sunshine between a crack of clouds from a gray sky I found 
it - my next, and current position, at _Dreamed Diabetes_.

Very similar to the previous job on the list, _Taliaz_, the work in _Dreamed Diabetes_ is all about doing good: Helping 
people with _Diabetes_ to live better. It doing it by getting their diabetes information, process it with a smart 
algorithm, and then provide a treatment plan which improves, and might saves, the patient's life. Surely, something not 
everyone can vouch for themself.

The work in _Dreamed Diabetes_ is achieved in technologies I could dreamed of at the time: _Python_ and _React_, which 
thrilled me a lot. But, not only the technologies makes me happy - there's so much more. Seeing how people live with 
diabetes and understanding that there's more than just inject themself _Insulin_ was shocking. I won't go deep but I can
say that there's a whole new world that unveiled to me, something that doesn't teach you a lot in schools and that's a 
shame.

We talked about the technical stuff, let's talk a bit about the people - wow! It's been a while since I found a place 
that keeps so many smart people in one place (well, they have to if they doing such a noble goal). But besides them 
being smart I can say that they heart-warming, bear-care people with the feet on the ground. I do believe I found a 
place that will forever stay in my heart.
