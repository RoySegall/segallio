            2018 was a rough year. I quit my job, and then I found another job which I loved very much. Then, I got
            fired.
            Surprisingly, I was looking for a job, again. Took me a couple of months but I found it. It was a, pardon my
            french,
            crappy job. It was so bad I rather not talk about it, and delete any reference of me being employed there.
            After three
            months I decided to quit and look for another job.

            This time, I knew what I was looking for and the search was grueling, each place was not interested in my
            skills or it
            was something I did not want to do. But then, like a ray of sunshine between a crack of clouds from a gray
            sky I found
            it - my next, and current position, at <em>Dreamed Diabetes</em>
        </>,

            Very similar to the previous job on the list, <em>Taliaz</em>, the work in <em>Dreamed Diabetes</em> is all
            about doing
            good: Helping
            people with <em>Diabetes</em> to live better. It doing it by getting their diabetes information, process it
            with a
            smart
            algorithm, and then provide a treatment plan which improves, and might saves, the patient's life. Surely,
            something not
            everyone can vouch for themself.</>,

            The work in <em>Dreamed Diabetes</em> is achieved in technologies I could dreamed of at the
            time: <em>Python</em> and
            <em>React</em>, which
            thrilled me a lot. But, not only the technologies makes me happy - there's so much more. Seeing how people
            live with
            diabetes and understanding that there's more than just inject themself <em>Insulin</em> was shocking. I
            won't go
            deep but I can
            say that there's a whole new world that, unveiled to me, something that doesn't teach you a lot in schools
            and that's a
            shame.

            We talked about the technical stuff, let's talk a bit about the people - wow! It's been a while since I
            found
            a place
            that keeps so many smart people in one place (well, they have to if they doing such a noble goal). But
            besides them
            being smart I can say that they heart-warming, bear-care people with the feet on the ground. I do believe I
            found a
            place that will forever stay in my heart.
