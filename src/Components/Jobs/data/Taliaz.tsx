            It true, I haven't been to a lot of companies over the years. I 'spent' 7 years at <em>gizra</em> while other
            people
            can work
            for at least 3 companies. But on the other hand, working for a company for 7 straight years indicates
            loyalty, it's a
            bonus. But in my case, a lot of companies decided that my experience is not what they looking and skips to
            the next
            contestant.

            <em>Taliaz</em> is a different story. After being sick and tired for looking for a job a friend told me that
            he knows
            someone
            that looks for a full-stack developer. I gave it a shot. The process was very quick and I felt that that
            company is
            different from the other companies I interviewed. It was a small startup that started the expansion: hiring
            two people
            and aims for being bigger.

            It was exactly something I was looking for. Being at a position where you can make a real impact. No longer a
            project
            with a company that after 1-2 years you don't have any relationship and the hard work you gave is not
            visible to your
            eyes. If I can describe it, it's like saying goodbye from one of your children.

            At <em>Taliaz</em> I was given the honor of starting to re-write the product. Choosing the backend (Symfony in
            my
            case) while
            the frontend will be chosen sometime in the future. In the beginning, I was looking for approval to do
            stuff. My CTO
            told me that I don't need it. Just build it. If it will not fit, we'll remove it. Then, something happens -
            a switch
            was turned on. From being used to wait for approval I needed to act fast and if something was bad, that's
            OK, we'll fix
            it and learn for the next time.

            But, it turns that nothing good was last forever and in my case, shorter than I ever expected. After two
            months, just
            when I started to warm up I got the bad news - I'm fired. It's because they were out of money - the expected
            funding has
            not arrived.

            P.S - I forgot to tell you what's <em>Taliaz</em> purpose: they came up with an incredible solution - helping
            people
            with
            depression to find the best matching medicine with fewer side effects. That job fits me well because I love
            'doing good'
            for other people.
